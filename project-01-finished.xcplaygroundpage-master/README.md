# project-01-finished.xcplaygroundpage
My finished project.  Hopefully with all associated files.  The purpose of this project is to create a soccer league, consisting of three 
teams, and populating the teams with players.  The player info was contained in a separate file (included in the git).  Must transfer
the info into project manually.  I did so inside the contents of a players array.  Next, the players must be initailly sorted into 2 
categories, experienced and inexperienced.  Then both the experienced and inexperienced players must be placed into teams evenly.  Also 
a way to deal with any additional players.  I simply catch them if an two if statements (i hope).  Lastly, a welcome letter must be drafted
and printed to the players guardian.
